# Analyzing Accident Severity in the San Jose Area

## Problem Statement

This research aims to analyze crashes, road conditions, and weather to identify the features that have the strongest correlation with accidents in the San Jose area. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can predict the severity of future accidents. The findings have the potential to positively impact decision-makers by helping them adapt policies to improve safety measures.

## Methodology

To predict injuries caused by car accidents, the following machine learning techniques will be utilized:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Neural Networks (LSTM)**

These techniques have been implemented in order of increasing algorithmic complexity. The data has been analyzed using various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques to extract key information that can be used to build the machine learning models. The analyses were performed using Python libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, pandas, plotly, and seaborn.

## Conclusion

The research aims to identify features that strongly contribute to car crashes and to make predictions on the severity of injuries resulting from these crashes. A potential drawback of this research is the inability to identify drivers involved in multiple accidents within a given time span due to privacy concerns. This level of detail could be beneficial in identifying risk patterns that lead to injuries. In the future, this research could be expanded by using data from cameras to automate the process of identifying the injury severity of car crashes.
